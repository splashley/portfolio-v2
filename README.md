## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Netlify, Vue.js

## Lessons Learned:
- Using Lighthouse (a tool for web developers), I learned that my website wasn't very accessible! Through that, I spent time on https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/ learning more about web accessibility and why we should be more inclusive with our websites. After making the necessary changes, my site now scores high in web accessibility. 
- Learned about the CSS property transition, which allows you to do create smooth visual effects on your site.
- Went through some trial and error to setup my website on Netlify, including having to change the DNS server on my domain.
